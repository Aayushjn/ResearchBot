    "    \"abstract\": \"In spite of recent rapid developments across various computer vision domains, numerous cutting-edge deep learning algorithms often demand a substantial volume of data to operate effectively. Within this research, a novel few-shot learning approach is presented with the objective of enhancing the accuracy of few-shot image classification. This task entails the classification of unlabeled query samples based on a limited set of labeled support examples. Specifically, the integration of the edge-conditioned graph neural network (EGNN) framework with hierarchical node residual connections is proposed. The primary aim is to enhance the performance of graph neural networks when applied to few-shot classification, a rather unconventional application of hierarchical node residual structures in few-shot image classification tasks. It is noteworthy that this work represents an innovative attempt to combine these two techniques. Extensive experimental findings on publicly available datasets demonstrate that the methodology surpasses the original EGNN algorithm, achieving a maximum improvement of 2.7%. Particularly significant is the performance gain observed on our custom-built dataset, CBAC (Car Brand Appearance Classification), which consistently outperforms the original method, reaching an impressive peak improvement of 11.14%.\",\n",

    "    \"abstract\": \"—CBIR deals with seeking of related images from large dataset, like Internet is a demanding task. Since last two decades scientists are working in this area in various angles. Deep learning provided state-of-the art result for image categorization and recovery. But pre-trained deep learning models are not strong enough to rotation and scale variations. A technique is proposed in this work to improve the precision and recall of image retrieval. This method concentrates on the extraction of high-level features with rotation and scaling invariant from ResNet18 CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model. These features used for segregation of images using VGG19 deep learning model. Finally, after classification if the class of given query image is correct, we will get the 100% results for both precision and recall as the ideal requirement of image retrieval technique. Our experimental results shows that not only our proposed technique outstrip current techniques for rotated and scaled query images but also it has preferable results for retrieval time requirements. The performance investigation exhibit that the presented method upgrades the average precision value from 76.50% for combined features DCD (Dominant Color Descriptor), wavelet and curvelet to 99.1% and average recall value from 14.21% to 19.82% for rotated and scaled images utilizing Corel dataset. Also, the average retrieval time required is 1.39 sec, which is lower than existing modern techniques.\",\n",

Knowledge Graphs are primarily classified concerning their building techniques and their usages. In building techniques, it is considered how the Knowledge Graph is built. For example, the graph can be constructed as a triplet, quadruplet, etc., or created from structured data, e.g., database, or unstructured data, e.g., text, image, etc. On the other hand, Knowledge Graphs can be used for various purposes. For example, Knowledge Graphs can be used for Information Retrieval, Semantic Query, etc., or different types of data visualization.

It is an essential procedure in a wide range of applications (e.g., classification & regression, deduplication, image retrieval, and recommender systems). Recently, representation learning and auto-encoding methods as well as pre-trained models have gained popularity. They basically deal with dense high-dimensional data, and this trend brings new opportunities and challenges to similarity query processing. Meanwhile, new techniques have emerged to tackle this long-standing problem theoretically and empirically. This tutorial aims to provide a comprehensive review of high-dimensional similarity query processing for data science. It introduces solutions from a variety of research communities, including data mining (DM), database (DB), machine learning (ML), computer vision (CV), natural language processing (NLP), and theoretical computer science (TCS), thereby highlighting the interplay between modern computer science and artificial intelligence technologies. We first discuss the importance of high-dimensional similarity query processing in data science applications, and then review query processing algorithms such as cover tree, locality sensitive hashing, product quantization, proximity graphs, as well as recent advancements such as learned indexes. We analyze their strengths and weaknesses and discuss the selection of algorithms in various application scenarios. Moreover, we consider the selectivity estimation of high-dimensional similarity queries, and show how researchers are bringing in state-of-the-art ML techniques to address this problem. We expect that this tutorial will provide an impetus towards new technologies for data science.\",\n",

    "    \"abstract\": \"—Image retrieval using a textual query becomes a major challenge mainly due to human perception subjectivity and the impreciseness of image annotations. These drawbacks can be overcome by focusing on the content of images rather than on the textual descriptions of images. Traditional feature extraction techniques demand for expert knowledge to select the limited feature types and are also sensitive to changing imaging conditions. Deep feature extraction using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) are a solution to these drawbacks as they can learn the feature representations automatically. This work carries out a detailed performance comparison of various pre-trained models of CNN in feature extraction. Features are extracted from men footwear and women clothing datasets using the VGG16, VGG19, InceptionV3, Xception and ResNet50 models. Further, these extracted features are used for classification using SVM, Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors classifiers. Results of feature extraction and image retrieval show that VGG19, Inception and Xception features perform well with feature extraction, achieving a good image classification accuracy of 97.5%. These results are further justified by performing a comparison of image retrieval efficiency, with the extracted features and similarity metrics. This work also compares the accuracy obtained by features extracted by the selected pre-trained CNN models with the results obtained using conventional classification techniques on CIFAR 10 dataset. The features extracted using CNN can be used in image-based systems like recommender systems, where images have to be analyzed to generate item profiles.\",\n",

    "    \"abstract\": \"Acquisition of labeled data for supervised Hyperspectral Image (HSI) classification is expensive in terms of both time and costs. Moreover, manual selection and labeling are often subjective and tend to induce redundancy into the classifier. Active learning (AL) can be a suitable approach for HSI classification as it integrates data acquisition to the classifier design by ranking the unlabeled data to provide advice for the next query that has the highest training utility. However, multiclass AL techniques tend to include redundant samples into the classifier to some extent. This paper addresses such a problem by introducing an AL pipeline which preserves the most representative and spatially heterogeneous samples. The adopted strategy for sample selection utilizes fuzziness to assess the mapping between actual output and the approximated a-posteriori probabilities, computed by a marginal probability distribution based on discriminative random fields. The samples selected in each iteration are then provided to the spectral angle mapper-based objective function to reduce the inter-class redundancy. Experiments on five HSI benchmark datasets confirmed that the proposed Fuzziness and Spectral Angle Mapper (FSAM)-AL pipeline presents competitive results compared to the state-of-the-art sample selection techniques, leading to lower computational requirements.\",\n",

The primary advantage being that active learning frameworks select data points that can accelerate the learning process of a model and can reduce the amount of data needed to achieve full accuracy as compared to a model trained on a randomly acquired data set. Multiple frameworks for active learning combined with deep learning have been proposed, and the majority of them are dedicated to classification tasks. Herein, we explore active learning for the task of segmentation of medical imaging data sets. We investigate our proposed framework using two datasets: 1.) MRI scans of the hippocampus, 2.) CT scans of pancreas and tumors. This work presents a query-by-committee approach for active learning where a joint optimizer is used for the committee. At the same time, we propose three new strategies for active learning: 1.) increasing frequency of uncertain data to bias the training data set; 2.) Using mutual information among the input images as a regularizer for acquisition to ensure diversity in the training dataset; 3.) adaptation of Dice log-likelihood for Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD). The results indicate an improvement in terms of data reduction by achieving full accuracy while only using 22.69% and 48.85% of the available data for each dataset, respectively.\",\n",

Currently, in domains such as few-shot image classification, it is common to use exhaustive search during query time which is inefficient in applications using distances with high computational complexity such as the EMD. Since the space in these applications is not guaranteed to be a vector space, existing techniques such as product quantization cannot be applied. In this paper, we study the application of metric space indexing structures towards the reduction of the number of EMD computations needed during query time. We conduct experiments on several image datasets in order to identify the advantages and disadvantages of different metric space data structures. These experiments have not been performed in the context of the EMD before and demonstrate that the VP-tree is more robust to increases in dataset complexity in this domain than comparable metric indexing data structures. Furthermore, we combine these data structures with deep feature extraction to develop a method for efficient deep image retrieval in metric spaces. Taking inspiration from distance stretching methods in the previous literature, we develop a novel approximate nearest neighbor algorithm for k-NN search that can greatly reduce the number of distance computations needed for retrieval without significantly changing k-NN accuracy.\",\n",

Knowledge Graphs are primarily classified concerning their building techniques and their usages. In building techniques, it is considered how the Knowledge Graph is built. For example, the graph can be constructed as a triplet, quadruplet, etc., or created from structured data, e.g., database, or unstructured data, e.g., text, image, etc. On the other hand, Knowledge Graphs can be used for various purposes. For example, Knowledge Graphs can be used for Information Retrieval, Semantic Query, etc., or different types of data visualization.

It is an essential procedure in a wide range of applications (e.g., classification & regression, deduplication, image retrieval, and recommender systems). Recently, representation learning and auto-encoding methods as well as pre-trained models have gained popularity. They basically deal with dense high-dimensional data, and this trend brings new opportunities and challenges to similarity query processing. Meanwhile, new techniques have emerged to tackle this long-standing problem theoretically and empirically. This tutorial aims to provide a comprehensive review of high-dimensional similarity query processing for data science. It introduces solutions from a variety of research communities, including data mining (DM), database (DB), machine learning (ML), computer vision (CV), natural language processing (NLP), and theoretical computer science (TCS), thereby highlighting the interplay between modern computer science and artificial intelligence technologies. We first discuss the importance of high-dimensional similarity query processing in data science applications, and then review query processing algorithms such as cover tree, locality sensitive hashing, product quantization, proximity graphs, as well as recent advancements such as learned indexes. We analyze their strengths and weaknesses and discuss the selection of algorithms in various application scenarios. Moreover, we consider the selectivity estimation of high-dimensional similarity queries, and show how researchers are bringing in state-of-the-art ML techniques to address this problem.

Yet, when limited training samples are available or when accompanied by noisy labels, severe degradation in accuracy can arise. The proposed work mainly focusses on these practical issues. Herein, standard datasets, i.e., Mini-ImageNet, CIFAR-FS, and CUB 200, are considered, which also have similar issues. The main goal is to utilize a few labeled data in the training stage, extracting image features and then performing feature similarity analysis across all samples. The highlighted aspects of the proposed method are as follows. (1) The main self-supervised learning strategies and augmentation techniques are exploited to obtain the best pretrained model.

These drawbacks can be overcome by focusing on the content of images rather than on the textual descriptions of images. Traditional feature extraction techniques demand for expert knowledge to select the limited feature types and are also sensitive to changing imaging conditions. Deep feature extraction using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) are a solution to these drawbacks as they can learn the feature representations automatically. This work carries out a detailed performance comparison of various pre-trained models of CNN in feature extraction. Features are extracted from men footwear and women clothing datasets using the VGG16, VGG19, InceptionV3, Xception and ResNet50 models. Further, these extracted features are used for classification using SVM, Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors classifiers. Results of feature extraction and image retrieval show that VGG19, Inception and Xception features perform well with feature extraction, achieving a good image classification accuracy of 97.5%. These results are further justified by performing a comparison of image retrieval efficiency, with the extracted features and similarity metrics. This work also compares the accuracy obtained by features extracted by the selected pre-trained CNN models with the results obtained using conventional classification techniques on CIFAR 10 dataset. The features extracted using CNN can be used in image-based systems like recommender systems, where images have to be analyzed to generate item profiles.', 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'http://thesai.org/Downloads/Volume13No12/Paper_77-Analysis_of_Content_Based_Image_Retrieval.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD'}, 'tldr': {'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'Results of feature extraction and image retrieval show that VGG19, Inception and Xception features perform well with feature extraction, achieving a good image classification accuracy of 97.5%.'}}\n",

Moreover, manual selection and labeling are often subjective and tend to induce redundancy into the classifier. Active learning (AL) can be a suitable approach for HSI classification as it integrates data acquisition to the classifier design by ranking the unlabeled data to provide advice for the next query that has the highest training utility. However, multiclass AL techniques tend to include redundant samples into the classifier to some extent. This paper addresses such a problem by introducing an AL pipeline which preserves the most representative and spatially heterogeneous samples. The adopted strategy for sample selection utilizes fuzziness to assess the mapping between actual output and the approximated a-posteriori probabilities, computed by a marginal probability distribution based on discriminative random fields. The samples selected in each iteration are then provided to the spectral angle mapper-based objective function to reduce the inter-class redundancy.

Multiple frameworks for active learning combined with deep learning have been proposed, and the majority of them are dedicated to classification tasks. Herein, we explore active learning for the task of segmentation of medical imaging data sets. We investigate our proposed framework using two datasets: 1.) MRI scans of the hippocampus, 2.) CT scans of pancreas and tumors. This work presents a query-by-committee approach for active learning where a joint optimizer is used for the committee. At the same time, we propose three new strategies for active learning: 1.) increasing frequency of uncertain data to bias the training data set; 2.) Using mutual information among the input images as a regularizer for acquisition to ensure diversity in the training dataset; 3.) adaptation of Dice log-likelihood for Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD).

Currently, in domains such as few-shot image classification, it is common to use exhaustive search during query time which is inefficient in applications using distances with high computational complexity such as the EMD. Since the space in these applications is not guaranteed to be a vector space, existing techniques such as product quantization cannot be applied. In this paper, we study the application of metric space indexing structures towards the reduction of the number of EMD computations needed during query time. We conduct experiments on several image datasets in order to identify the advantages and disadvantages of different metric space data structures. These experiments have not been performed in the context of the EMD before and demonstrate that the VP-tree is more robust to increases in dataset complexity in this domain than comparable metric indexing data structures. Furthermore, we combine these data structures with deep feature extraction to develop a method for efficient deep image retrieval in metric spaces. Taking inspiration from distance stretching methods in the previous literature, we develop a novel approximate nearest neighbor algorithm for k-NN search that can greatly reduce the number of distance computations needed for retrieval without significantly changing k-NN accuracy.\", 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3615890.3628531', 'status': 'HYBRID'}, 'tldr': {'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'A novel approximate nearest neighbor algorithm for k-NN search that can greatly reduce the number of distance computations needed for retrieval without significantly changing k-nn accuracy is developed.'}}\n",
