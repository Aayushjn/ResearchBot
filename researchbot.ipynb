Specifically, the integration of the edge-conditioned graph neural network (EGNN) framework with hierarchical node residual connections is proposed. The primary aim is to enhance the performance of graph neural networks when applied to few-shot classification, a rather unconventional application of hierarchical node residual structures in few-shot image classification tasks. It is noteworthy that this work represents an innovative attempt to combine these two techniques. Extensive experimental findings on publicly available datasets demonstrate that the methodology surpasses the original EGNN algorithm, achieving a maximum improvement of 2.7%.

These drawbacks can be overcome by focusing on the content of images rather than on the textual descriptions of images. Traditional feature extraction techniques demand for expert knowledge to select the limited feature types and are also sensitive to changing imaging conditions. Deep feature extraction using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) are a solution to these drawbacks as they can learn the feature representations automatically. This work carries out a detailed performance comparison of various pre-trained models of CNN in feature extraction. Features are extracted from men footwear and women clothing datasets using the VGG16, VGG19, InceptionV3, Xception and ResNet50 models. Further, these extracted features are used for classification using SVM, Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors classifiers. Results of feature extraction and image retrieval show that VGG19, Inception and Xception features perform well with feature extraction, achieving a good image classification accuracy of 97.5%. These results are further justified by performing a comparison of image retrieval efficiency, with the extracted features and similarity metrics. This work also compares the accuracy obtained by features extracted by the selected pre-trained CNN models with the results obtained using conventional classification techniques on CIFAR 10 dataset.

Moreover, manual selection and labeling are often subjective and tend to induce redundancy into the classifier. Active learning (AL) can be a suitable approach for HSI classification as it integrates data acquisition to the classifier design by ranking the unlabeled data to provide advice for the next query that has the highest training utility. However, multiclass AL techniques tend to include redundant samples into the classifier to some extent. This paper addresses such a problem by introducing an AL pipeline which preserves the most representative and spatially heterogeneous samples. The adopted strategy for sample selection utilizes fuzziness to assess the mapping between actual output and the approximated a-posteriori probabilities, computed by a marginal probability distribution based on discriminative random fields. The samples selected in each iteration are then provided to the spectral angle mapper-based objective function to reduce the inter-class redundancy.

Currently, in domains such as few-shot image classification, it is common to use exhaustive search during query time which is inefficient in applications using distances with high computational complexity such as the EMD. Since the space in these applications is not guaranteed to be a vector space, existing techniques such as product quantization cannot be applied. In this paper, we study the application of metric space indexing structures towards the reduction of the number of EMD computations needed during query time. We conduct experiments on several image datasets in order to identify the advantages and disadvantages of different metric space data structures. These experiments have not been performed in the context of the EMD before and demonstrate that the VP-tree is more robust to increases in dataset complexity in this domain than comparable metric indexing data structures. Furthermore, we combine these data structures with deep feature extraction to develop a method for efficient deep image retrieval in metric spaces.
